            Have you ever imagined yourself living in a different time, in a different culture, with different people? Would you make similar choices? Would you still be you?
        </h3>
        <p>
            My name is Noa and this is an invitation to a Worldwide Roleplaying Game, an expedition, that dives into the deep mysterious sea of collective knowledge where, perhaps, we can all meet.<br /><br />
            The Mission:<br /><br />
            Discovering the Story in a different time and place.<br /><br />
            The Game:<br /><br />
            Think of Five soulmates: The Victim, The Leader, The Romantic, The Realist & The Messiah who meet each other every life in a different spot in human evolution, but every time they meet, they are embodied in new characters. In every Game, Five players team up to create a group, and using the methods of trance and brainstorming they travel to a different period to discover who they are over there and what is their shared story.<br /><br />
            How does it work:<br /><br />
            Once we have 5 players, we choose where and when we want to travel to, for example – The French Revolution. Then, I meet each player for a personal, one-on-one trance session - the Intuitive Journey: you come to my place (or another place with a bed/sofa), lay down, close your eyes and I talk you to relaxation. When you are in a state of mild trance, that is, all senses directed inwards but still fully aware, we dive into the traveling point in order to find your Character, in that case a person living in Paris 1792. Step by step, we uncover and get to know him/her and their rich, full and unique world. The journey feels a bit like watching a movie and being in a movie at the same time; it takes about one hour and only happens once. During the journey I’m talking with you, asking you questions and writing everything down.<br /><br />
            Now that we have Five Characters living their lives in Paris 1792, I cast each one of you as one of the soulsmates: The Victim The Leader The Romantic The Realist The Messiah.<br /><br />
            As we meet all together in the first Brainstorming Session, each one presents “themselves” and we begin to find connections between the characters, based on features, locations and details that were uncovered during the private journeys: Who is related to whom, and how? … Why is he annoying me? … Am I attracted to her? How come, do we know each other...? … Hi, you’re poor, I run a business … You work at the bakery? I’m hungry. … You’re sick of the situation? Vive la résistance! I know some people... And so, step by step, a Net of Relationships is being created, and on this net, we’re building our story.<br /><br />
            Passion & Vision:<br /><br />
            The Intuitive Story project is just starting but… if every game happens in a different time and place, and ends up with a story, we’re practically writing our History, Intuitively! The list of places, times, themes and characters is endless and in time those stories can be added together to be a big, joint-colorful creation made by us, based on us, playing in our endless playground.<br /><br />
            So:<br /><br />
            Where will you travel to? Past? Future? Who are you in Ancient Egypt or aboard Columbus’ ship? How old are you? What do you look like? Who do you love? What makes you tick? Are you the Victim? The Realist? The Romantic? Leader or Messiah? Who is your gang and what is your story?<br />
            Join The Intuitive Story’s expedition and let’s travel!<br /><br /><br />
            Q & A:<br /><br />
            How do I play? You can either Create a Group by gathering 4 other people who’re into the same Traveling Point as you; maybe you share an interest about a culture or a theme? Or you can Join a Group with a random Traveling Point and random people and let the game choose for you. Either way, you can start by wirting me an email and we’ll take it from there - theintuitivestory@gmail.com<br /><br />
            Where can we play? Everywhere! I’d love to travel and lead the game all over the world. Gather a Group, invite me and I’ll come.<br /><br />
            What are the requirements? Anyone can play. You don’t need previous knowledge in history, writing or anything else. You do need though to dedicate the time and attention for the creative precess; this is not just an entertainmening/ fun/ interesting workshop - we’re creating a piece together and it requires some devotion. Whatever happens within the group is unpredictable and depends on the unique combination of the people, the characters and the story itself.<br /><br />
            What do I get out of it? The purpose and nature of The Intuitive Story are to explore and deepen the Intuitive language which touches us all and reminds us that we are one. So first of all, I would say - connection. Now, exept for being social in an interesting fertile way, during the sessions we’re exploring and experiencing creativity, history, ourselves and togetherness not from the conscious academic mind, but from the most enigmatic and yet familiar place – our intuition. Everything in the game has to be intuitive so we don’t decide things in advance; we let things reveal themselves instead of forcing them. That kind of “listening” is something one can practice in every espect of life, and if you let it take you, it goes pretty deep in many directions. It’s very personal intimite experience. Plus, when we’ll eventuallyexecute our storys, there will be a character based on you.<br /><br />
            How much it costs? In keeping with the Game’s intuitive state of mind, also the price for participating cannot be fixed. Just as we want the creative details to reveal themselves, the material details are no different. It’s a part of the Game. Using the Dāna method, we can cultivate sharing out of will and trust also when it comes to money. And like a great Vipasana teacher once said: you know you gave enough when it hurts a little.<br /><br />
            Is this some kind of therapy? As we’re exploring many layers of the time, space, communication and existance The Intuitive Story has a strong therapeutic effect, yet I don’t call it and don’t see it as Therapy. It is Creative, and like any creative activity, it has a therapeutic effect.<br /><br />
            What is this Trance exactly? This is not Hypnosis, you are in full awareness and control at all time. if anything, this is more similar to guided-imagination, only we want the journey itself to guid us. To be honest, we don’t need anything to get in touch with our intuition, it is there all the time, available and transmitting, but we’re not so used to hear it, so the MIND needs a little manipulation - “Hi... we’re going into trance, ooohhh, exciting... ok, I’ll play along...”. That’s all. “A trance state” is very femiliar to us in our daily lives; it happens when we dream and before falling asleep, while being focused on something or while watching a TV serie, reading a book or playing video games. It is basically, being open to “another reality” and allowing it to effect us.<br /><br />
