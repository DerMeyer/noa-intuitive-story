            How the Game works
        </h3>
        <p>
            Five players team up to create a group and by using methods of trance and brainstorming they travel to a different period in human evolution to meet as new characters. Each character is embodied with a soul: <span>The Victim, The Leader, The Romantic, The Realist & The Messiah.</span> Now, as soulmates in this lifetime, their mission is to discover what their shared story is.<br /><br />
            First step – One on One Intuitive Journeys:<br /><br />
            Once we have 5 players, we choose where and when we want to travel to, for example – The French Revolution. Then, I meet each player for a personal, one-on-one trance session - the <span>Intuitive Journey</span>: you come to my place (or another place with a bed/sofa), lay down, close your eyes and I talk you to relaxation. When you are in a state of mild trance, that is, all senses directed inwards but still fully aware, we dive into the traveling point in order to find your <span>Character</span>, in that case a person living in Paris 1792. Step by step, we uncover and get to know him/her and their rich, full and unique world. The journey feels a bit like watching a movie and being in a movie at the same time; it takes about one hour and only happens once. During the journey I’m talking with you, asking you questions and writing everything down.<br /><br />
            Second step – Brainstorming Group Sessions:<br /><br />
            Now that we have <span>Five Characters</span> living their lives in Paris 1792, we meet for the first time.<br /><br />
            We sit around a nice big table with snacks and drinks; each one receives their written Journey and presents “themselves” to the others (just telling, not acting like in theater). While one speaks, the others write down intuitive notes according to “their” own character - for example: Why is he annoying me? … Am I attracted to her? How come, do we know each other...? … Hi, you’re poor, I run a business … You work at the bakery? I’m hungry. … You’re sick of the situation? Vive la résistance! I know some people...<br /><br />
            During this whole process I feel and I cast each one of you as one of the soulmates: Who is The Victim, The Leader, The Romantic, The Realist & The Messiah.<br /><br />
            Now, based on our little “intuitive pool of information” (which is a mix of us, the journeys and the souls) we begin to find connections between the characters: Who is related to whom, and how? And so, step by step, a <span>Net of Relationships is being created, and on this net, we’re building our story.</span><br /><br />
            <span>So</span> where will you travel to? Past? Future? Who are you in Ancient Egypt or aboard Columbus’ ship? How old are you? What do you look like? Who do you love? What makes you tick? Are you the Victim? The Realist? The Romantic? Leader or Messiah? <span>Who is your gang and what is your story?</span>

            Purpose and Vision
        </h3>
        <p>
            The purpose and nature of The Intuitive Story are to explore and deepen the Intuitive Language which touches us all and reminds us that we are one, we are all connected. Everything we do here - serves this. Only holding this fact in mind can bring a lot of patience and empathy to the world.<br /><br />
            We are an expedition that dives into the deep mysterious sea of collective knowledge to explore and experience creativity and history but not from the conscious-academic mind, but from the most enigmatic and yet familiar place – our intuition. Everything in the game has to be intuitive so we always want to let things reveal themselves instead of forcing them. Every piece of information is welcome.<br /><br />
            Every game happens in a different time and place, and ends up with a story, so we’re <span>practically writing our History together, intuitively.</span> In time, those stories can be added together to create a big, joint, colorful creation made by us, based on us playing in our endless playground.<br /><br />

            The Five Souls
        </h3>
        <p>
            At this stage I don’t want to say much about the souls because it might influence your Intuitive Journey. As you may have read before, everything in the game is intuitive so in a way, the less we KNOW the better we go. But yeah, like everything in the game, also the website is learning itself step by step so here is some basic information. Let’s see what happens.<br /><br />
            All souls are motivated by the thing they’re LACKing - that’s why it motivates them.<br /><br />
            <span style={{ color: 'orange' }}>Gul</span> <span>- The Victim spirit</span> is driven by Control, He’s natural gender is male but can of course be born as a woman too. The victim’s role in the group is to unite them through some kind of weakness. His color is Yellow and his Element is Fire.<br /><br />
            <span style={{ color: 'green' }}>Grun</span> <span>- The Leader spirit</span> is driven by Freedom. He’s natural gender is male but can of course be born as a woman too. The Leader’s role is to collect the group and be responsible for its safety. His color is Green and his Element is Air.<br /><br />
            <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Vermel</span> <span>- The Romantic spirit</span> is driven by Love. Her natural gender is female but can of course be born as a man too. The Romantic’s role in the group is to stimulate emotions and flood issues. Her color is Red and her Element is water.<br /><br />
            <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>Bezrechu</span> <span>- The Realist spirit</span> is driven by Survival. He’s natural gender is male but can of course be born as a woman too. The Realist’s role in the group is to reset, stabilize and balance them. His color is Blue and his Element is Earth.<br /><br />
            <span style={{ color: 'purple' }}>Sagol</span> <span>- The Messiah spirit</span> is driven by Recognition. Her natural gender is female but can of course be born as a man too. The Messiah’s role in the group is to navigate them according to the spirit of the time. Her color is Purple and her Element is Aether (space).

            Hi!<br /><br />
            I want to tell you here how it all started in Tel Aviv 2010 and became this in 2018 but I don’t stand the deadline! For now here is my picture, my name is Noa, I live in Berlin but would love to lead Games all over the world. Beside The Intuitive Story Game, I also practice the intuitive space in a daily-life; no time traveling, but actually the very much Here and Now ☺ with myself and with others in one-on-one sessions. I also host Karaoke nights at Monster Ronson’s which is lots of fun.<br /><br />
            To be continued…!
